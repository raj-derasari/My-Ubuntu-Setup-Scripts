The default should be made the files one that I originally wrote

Maybe do something about saving successful and failed outputs to files?
Should I set up a debug mode? What would it do? Dry is enough ye?
Add pycharm etc. check TODOs
Document and Define Exit Codes
Do something about logging errors specifically (is log_errors.txt enough?)

Left todos with lower priority:
1.	For short code blocks, replace if []; then {} else {} fi -- with [] && {} || {} -- for optimization?
2.	Replace if choice==y or choice ==Y like this:
	  Replace
		if [choice == y] or [choice == Y]; then { a } else { b } fi
	  with
		if [ "$choice" != "${choice#[Yy]}" ]; then {a} else {b} fi

3.	Tensorflow does not install virtualenv, hence cannot be executed independently/on-first-run... 
	Same applies to Python script too, I guess? Don't know, must check!

4.	Octave - Work In Progress - Should be easy to make it Final now, the commands are verified to be working
	Maybe test it out in VMs

5.	Make it so that every script can write its finished-status onto /tmp/<>
	So that it is not rerun or something? idk what i'm really thinking but its doable

6.	VPN setup ? Which VPN, why and hows?

7.	Can extract Templates.tar.gz to user's ~/Templates (maybe ask maybe make variable - not sure)

8.	Test out this regex; goal is to replace default DNS with Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or OpenDNS
	sed 'a/dns-nameservers.\*/dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220/g' /etc/network/interfaces
