The default should be made the files one that I originally wrote

Make current mode (prints everything to stdout) as verbose <- or maybe not even that -> make verbose print command before exec
but save the outputs to files anyway?
dont know how/what to setup in debug mode

add pycharm etc. check TODOs
Document and Define Error Codes and ...
Logging - Which I basically reverted during this last build
(fix Logging and error messages)

Can choose to optimize the if conditions for checking "y" and "Y" -> currently case insensitive comparison all across.
Tensorflow does not install virtualenv, hence cannot be executed independently/on-first-run
Same applies to Python script too, I guess? Don't know, must check!

Octave - Work In Progress
Maybe test it out in the VMs
Make it so that every script can write its finished-status onto /tmp/<> - So that it is not rerun or something? idk what i'm really thinking but its doable
Mozilla Thunderbird
VPN setup ?
Can extract Tempaltes to user templates (maybe ask maybe make variable IDK)
